Go + Typescript for Embedded development? Not Possible? It is, Gomini!

### What does Gomini mean?

Gomini is actually a combination of Go(lang) and Mini(mal) which both is related
to embedded (small) device development and also, and that becomes clear when 
digging into the codebase, it also stands for Gimini. The astrological sign of the
Zodiac. Gimini is, again, used for two reasons; the twins represent Go and 
Typescript and Zodiac is the device this framework was originally developed for.
